## Section 5: Machine Learning
Using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation, create a machine learning model to predict the buying price given the following parameters:

Maintenance = High <br>
Number of doors = 4 <br>
Lug Boot Size = Big <br>
Safety = High <br>
Class Value = Good <br>

## Notes
The notebook can be found in the accompanying file `car_evaluation.ipynb`. While the prediction is slightly better than random (~30% vs ~25%), there are potentially other areas of improvement that could be explored if there was more time. For example, testing out other model types like SVMs, Gradient boosting and KNN. It might also be possible to use multiple models in an ensemble approach, that might provide a more robust prediction.
